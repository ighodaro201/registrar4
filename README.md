Osita Ighodaro and Ben Musoke-Lubega Assignment 4

I (Osita) worked on preparing the bash files and going over some error 
handling in the modularised file for the new assignment. I also went over 
the AJAX in the file. I also designed the error pages for the new website.

We spent like 8 hours on the assignment

It helped us learn about how to use AJAX, and further helped our 
understanding of html and CSS.
